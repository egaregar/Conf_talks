Moving Forward
By President Russell M.Nelson
President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
The work of the Lord is steadily moving forward.
My dear brothers and sisters, what a joy it is to be with you as we begin the 190th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
I love joining with you in your homes or wherever you are to listen together to the messages of prophets, seers, and revelators and other Church leaders.
How grateful we are for the technology that allows us to be connected as one great worldwide gathering of disciples of Jesus Christ.
General conference last April was viewed by more people than any preceding it, and we have every expectation that will happen again.
During the past few months, a global pandemic, raging wildfires, and other natural disasters have turned our world upside down.
I grieve with each of you who has lost a loved one during this time.
And I pray for all who are currently suffering.
Meanwhile, the work of the Lord is steadily moving forward.
Amid social distancing, face masks, and Zoom meetings, we have learned to do some things differently and some even more effectively.
Unusual times can bring unusual rewards.
Our missionaries and mission leaders have been resourceful, resilient, and truly remarkable.
Although most missionaries have had to find new, creative ways to do their work, many missions have reported doing more teaching than ever.
We had to close temples for a time, and some construction projects were briefly delayed, but now they are all moving forward.
In the calendar year 2020, we will have broken ground for 20 new temples!
Family history work has increased exponentially.
Many new wards and stakes have been created.
And we are gratified to report that the Church has provided pandemic humanitarian aid for 895 projects in 150 countries.
Increased gospel study in many homes is resulting in stronger testimonies and family relationships.
One mother wrote: “We feel much closer to our children and grandchildren now that we gather on Zoom every Sunday.
Each takes a turn giving their thoughts on Come, Follow Me.
Prayers for our family members have changed because we better understand what they need.”
I pray that we as a people are using this unique time to grow spiritually.
We are here on earth to be tested, to see if we will choose to follow Jesus Christ, to repent regularly, to learn, and to progress.
Our spirits long to progress.
And we do that best by staying firmly on the covenant path.
Through it all, our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, love us! They care for us! They and Their holy angels are watching over us.
I know that is true.
As we gather to hear the words the Lord has inspired His servants to deliver, I invite you to ponder a promise the Lord made.
He declared that “whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning … and the wiles of the devil, and lead the [disciple] of Christ in a strait and narrow course.”
I pray that you will choose to lay hold upon the word of God as it is declared during this general conference.
And I pray that you may feel the Lord’s perfect love for you, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
We Will Prove Them Herewith
(Abraham 3:25)
By Elder David A. Bednar
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
Now is the time to prepare and prove ourselves willing and able to do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us.
I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost for all of us as I share the thoughts and feelings that have come to my mind and heart in preparation for this general conference.
The Importance of Tests
For more than two decades before my call to full-time Church service, I worked as a university teacher and administrator.
My primary responsibility as a teacher was to help students learn how to learn for themselves.
And a vital element of my work was creating, grading, and providing feedback about student performance on tests.
As you may already know from personal experience, tests typically are not the part of the learning process that students like the most!
But periodic tests absolutely are essential to learning.
An effective test helps us to compare what we need to know with what we actually know about a specific subject; it also provides a standard against which we can evaluate our learning and development.
Likewise, tests in the school of mortality are a vital element of our eternal progression.
Interestingly, however, the word test is not found even one time in the scriptural text of the standard works in English.
Rather, words such as prove, examine, and try are used to describe various patterns of demonstrating appropriately our spiritual knowledge about, understanding of, and devotion to our Heavenly Father’s eternal plan of happiness and our capacity to seek for the blessings of the Savior’s Atonement.
He who authored the plan of salvation described the very purpose of our mortal probation using the words prove, examine, and try in ancient and modern scripture.
“And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them.”
Consider this pleading by the Psalmist David:
“Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
“For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.”
And the Lord declared in 1833, “Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.”
Present-Day Proving and Trying
The year 2020 has been marked, in part, by a global pandemic that has proved, examined, and tried us in many ways.
I pray that we as individuals and families are learning the valuable lessons that only challenging experiences can teach us.
I also hope that all of us will more fully acknowledge the “greatness of God” and the truth that “he shall consecrate [our] afflictions for [our] gain.”
Two basic principles can guide and strengthen us as we face proving and trying circumstances in our lives, whatever they may be: (1) the principle of preparation and (2) the principle of pressing forward with a steadfastness in Christ.
Proving and Preparation
As disciples of the Savior, we are commanded to “prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God.”
We also are promised that “if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.
“And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without spot and blameless.”
These scriptures provide a perfect framework for organizing and preparing our lives and homes both temporally and spiritually.
Our efforts to prepare for the proving experiences of mortality should follow the example of the Savior, who incrementally “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man”—a blended balance of intellectual, physical, spiritual, and social readiness.
On an afternoon a few months ago, Susan and I inventoried our food storage and emergency supplies.
At the time, COVID-19 was spreading rapidly, and a series of earthquakes had jolted our home in Utah.
We have worked since the earliest days of our marriage to follow prophetic counsel about preparing for unforeseen challenges, so “examining” our state of readiness in the midst of the virus and earthquakes seemed like a good and timely thing to do.
We wanted to find out our grades on these unannounced tests.
We learned a great deal.
In many areas, our preparatory work was just right.
In some other areas, however, improvement was necessary because we had not recognized and addressed particular needs in timely ways.
We also laughed a lot.
We discovered, for example, items in a remote closet that had been in our food storage for decades.
Frankly, we were afraid to open and inspect some of the containers for fear of unleashing another global pandemic!
But you should be happy to know that we properly disposed of the hazardous materials and that health risk to the world was eliminated.
Some Church members opine that emergency plans and supplies, food storage, and 72-hour kits must not be important anymore because the Brethren have not spoken recently and extensively about these and related topics in general conference.
But repeated admonitions to prepare have been proclaimed by leaders of the Church for decades.
The consistency of prophetic counsel over time creates a powerful concert of clarity and a warning volume far louder than solo performances can ever produce.
Just as challenging times reveal inadequacies in temporal preparedness, so too the maladies of spiritual casualness and complacency inflict their most detrimental effects during difficult trials.
We learn, for example, in the parable of the ten virgins that procrastinating preparation leads to unsuccessful proving.
Recall how the five foolish virgins failed to prepare appropriately for the examination given to them on the day of the bridegroom’s coming.
“They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
“But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
…
“And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
“Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
“And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
“But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
“And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
“Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.”
“But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, Ye know me not.”
At least on this exam, the five foolish virgins proved themselves to be hearers only and not doers of the word.
I have a friend who was a conscientious student in law school.
During the course of a semester, Sam invested time every day to review, summarize, and learn from his notes for each course in which he was enrolled.
He followed the same pattern for all of his classes at the end of every week and every month.
His approach enabled him to learn the law and not merely memorize details.
And as final examinations approached, Sam was prepared.
In fact, he found the final exam period to be one of the least stressful parts of his legal training.
Effective and timely preparation precedes successful proving.
Sam’s approach to his legal education highlights one of the Lord’s primary patterns for growth and development.
“Thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more.”
I invite each of us to “consider [our] ways” and “examine [ourselves], whether [we] be in the faith; [and] prove [our] own selves.” What have we learned during these recent months of lifestyle adjustments and restrictions? What do we need to improve in our lives spiritually, physically, socially, emotionally, and intellectually? Now is the time to prepare and prove ourselves willing and able to do all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall command us.
Proving and Pressing Forward
I once attended a funeral for a young missionary who was killed in an accident.
The missionary’s father spoke in the service and described the heartache of an unexpected mortal separation from a beloved child.
He forthrightly declared that he personally did not understand the reasons or timing for such an event.
But I always will remember this good man also declaring that he knew God knew the reasons and timing for the passing of his child—and that was good enough for him.
He told the congregation that he and his family, though sorrowful, would be fine; their testimonies remained firm and steadfast.
He concluded his remarks with this declaration: “I want you to know that as far as the gospel of Jesus Christ is concerned, our family is all in.
We are all in.”
Though the loss of a dear loved one was heart-wrenching and difficult, the members of this valiant family spiritually were prepared to prove that they could learn lessons of eternal importance through the things that they suffered.
Faithfulness is not foolishness or fanaticism.
Rather, it is trusting and placing our confidence in Jesus Christ as our Savior, on His name, and in His promises.
As we “press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men,” we are blessed with an eternal perspective and vision that stretches far beyond our limited mortal capacity.
We will be enabled to “gather together, and stand in holy places” and “be not moved, until the day of the Lord come.”
While I was serving as the president of Brigham Young University–Idaho, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland came to the campus in December 1998 to speak in one of our weekly devotionals.
Susan and I invited a group of students to meet and visit with Elder Holland before he delivered his message.
As our time together was drawing to a close, I asked Elder Holland, “If you could teach these students just one thing, what would it be?”
He answered:
“We are witnessing an ever greater movement toward polarity.
The middle-ground options will be removed from us as Latter-day Saints.
The middle of the road will be withdrawn.
“If you are treading water in the current of a river, you will go somewhere.
You simply will go wherever the current takes you.
Going with the stream, following the tide, drifting in the current will not do.
“Choices have to be made.
Not making a choice is a choice.
Learn to choose now.”
Elder Holland’s statement about increasing polarization has been proven prophetic by the societal trends and events of the 22 years since he answered my question.
Foretelling the widening divergence between the ways of the Lord and of the world, Elder Holland warned that the days of comfortably having one foot in the restored Church and one foot in the world were vanishing quickly.
This servant of the Lord was encouraging the young people to choose, prepare, and become devoted disciples of the Savior.
He was helping them to prepare and press forward to and through the proving, examining, and trying experiences of their lives.
Promise and Testimony
The process of proving ourselves is a fundamental part of Heavenly Father’s great plan of happiness.
I promise that as we both prepare and press forward with faith in the Savior, we all can receive the same grade on the ultimate examination of mortality: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.”
I witness that God the Eternal Father is our Father.
Jesus Christ is His Only Begotten and living Son, our Savior and Redeemer.
Of these truths I joyfully testify in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.
Hearts Knit in Righteousness and Unity
By Elder Quentin L. Cook
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
At this 200-year hinge point in our Church history, let us commit ourselves to live righteously and be united as never before.
Righteousness and unity are profoundly significant.
When people love God with all their hearts and righteously strive to become like Him, there is less strife and contention in society.
There is more unity.
I love a true account that exemplifies this.
As a young man not of our faith, General Thomas L. Kane assisted and defended the Saints as they were required to flee Nauvoo.
He was an advocate for the Church for many years.
In 1872, General Kane, his talented wife, Elizabeth Wood Kane, and their two sons traveled from their home in Pennsylvania to Salt Lake City.
They accompanied Brigham Young and his associates on a trek south to St. George, Utah.
Elizabeth approached her first visit to Utah with reservations about the women.
She was surprised by some of the things she learned.
For instance, she found that any career by which a woman could earn a living was open to them in Utah.
She also found Church members were kind and understanding with respect to Native Americans.
During the trip they stayed in Fillmore at the home of Thomas R. and Matilda Robison King.
Elizabeth wrote that as Matilda was preparing a meal for President Young and his company, five American Indians came into the room.
Although uninvited, it was clear they expected to join the company.
Sister King spoke to them “in their dialect.” They sat down with their blankets with a pleasant look on their faces.
Elizabeth asked one of the King children, “What did your mother say to those men?”
Matilda’s son’s reply was, “She said ‘These strangers came first, and I have only cooked enough for them; but your meal is on the fire cooking now, and I will call you as soon as it is ready.’”
Elizabeth asked, “Will she really do that, or just give them scraps at the kitchen-door?”
Matilda’s son answered, “Mother will serve them just as she does you, and give them a place at her table.”
And so she did, and “they ate with perfect propriety.” Elizabeth explained that this hostess rose 100 percent in her opinion.
Unity is enhanced when people are treated with dignity and respect, even though they are different in outward characteristics.
As leaders, we are not under the illusion that in the past all relationships were perfect, all conduct was Christlike, or all decisions were just.
However, our faith teaches that we are all children of our Father in Heaven, and we worship Him and His Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Savior.
Our desire is that our hearts and minds will be knit in righteousness and unity and that we will be one with Them.
Righteousness is a broad, comprehensive term but most certainly includes living God’s commandments.
It qualifies us for the sacred ordinances that constitute the covenant path and blesses us to have the Spirit give direction to our lives.
Being righteous is not dependent on each of us having every blessing in our lives at this time.
We may not be married or blessed with children or have other desired blessings now.
But the Lord has promised that the righteous who are faithful “may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.”
Unity is also a broad, comprehensive term but most certainly exemplifies the first and second great commandments to love God and love our fellowmen.
It denotes a Zion people whose hearts and minds are “knit together in unity.”
The context for my message is the contrast and lessons from sacred scriptures.
It has been 200 years since the Father and His Son first appeared and commenced the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in 1820.
The account in 4 Nephi in the Book of Mormon includes a similar 200-year period after the Savior appeared and established His Church in ancient America.
The historical record we read in 4 Nephi describes a people where there were no envyings, strifes, tumults, lyings, murders, or any manner of lasciviousness.
Because of this righteousness, the record states, “surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.”
With respect to unity, 4 Nephi reads, “There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people.”
Unfortunately, 4 Nephi then describes a dramatic change that began in the “two hundred and first year,” when iniquity and division destroyed righteousness and unity.
The depths of depravity that then occurred were subsequently so evil that ultimately the great prophet Mormon laments to his son Moroni:
“But O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in so much abomination—
“How can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment against us?”
In this dispensation, although we live in a special time, the world has not been blessed with the righteousness and unity described in 4 Nephi.
Indeed, we live in a moment of particularly strong divisions.
However, the millions who have accepted the gospel of Jesus Christ have committed themselves to achieving both righteousness and unity.
We are all aware that we can do better, and that is our challenge in this day.
We can be a force to lift and bless society as a whole.
At this 200-year hinge point in our Church history, let us commit ourselves as members of the Lord’s Church to live righteously and be united as never before.
President Russell M. Nelson has asked us “to demonstrate greater civility, racial and ethnic harmony and mutual respect.”
This means loving each other and God and accepting everyone as brothers and sisters and truly being a Zion people.
With our all-inclusive doctrine, we can be an oasis of unity and celebrate diversity.
Unity and diversity are not opposites.
We can achieve greater unity as we foster an atmosphere of inclusion and respect for diversity.
During the period I served in the San Francisco California Stake presidency, we had Spanish-, Tongan-, Samoan-, Tagalog-, and Mandarin-language-speaking congregations.
Our English-speaking wards were composed of people from many racial and cultural backgrounds.
There was love, righteousness, and unity.
Wards and branches in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are determined by geography or language, not by race or culture.
Race is not identified on membership records.
Early in the Book of Mormon, approximately 550 years before the birth of Christ, we are taught the fundamental commandment regarding the relationship between Father in Heaven’s children.
All are to keep the Lord’s commandments, and all are invited to partake of the Lord’s goodness; “and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.”
The Savior’s ministry and message have consistently declared all races and colors are children of God.
We are all brothers and sisters.
In our doctrine we believe that in the host country for the Restoration, the United States, the U.S.
Constitution and related documents, written by imperfect men, were inspired by God to bless all people.
As we read in the Doctrine and Covenants, these documents were “established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles.” Two of these principles were agency and accountability for one’s own sins.
The Lord declared:
“Therefore, it is not right that any man should be in bondage one to another.
“And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.”
This revelation was received in 1833 when the Saints in Missouri were suffering great persecution.
The heading to Doctrine and Covenants section 101 reads in part: “Mobs had driven them from their homes in Jackson County.
… Threats of death against [members] of the Church were many.”
This was a time of tension on several fronts.
Many Missourians considered Native Americans a relentless enemy and wanted them removed from the land.
In addition, many of the Missouri settlers were slave owners and felt threatened by those who were opposed to slavery.
In contrast, our doctrine respected the Native Americans, and our desire was to teach them the gospel of Jesus Christ.
With respect to slavery, our scriptures had made it clear that no man should be in bondage to another.
Ultimately, the Saints were violently driven out of Missouri and then forced to move to the West.
The Saints prospered and found the peace that accompanies righteousness, unity, and living the gospel of Jesus Christ.
I rejoice in the Savior’s Intercessory Prayer recorded in the Gospel of John.
The Savior acknowledged that the Father had sent Him and that He, the Savior, had finished the work He was sent to do.
He prayed for His disciples and for those who would believe in Christ: “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.”
Oneness is what Christ prayed for prior to His betrayal and Crucifixion.
In the first year after the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, recorded in section 38 of the Doctrine and Covenants, the Lord speaks of wars and wickedness and declares, “I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.”
Our Church culture comes from the gospel of Jesus Christ.
The Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Romans is profound.
The early Church in Rome was composed of Jews and Gentiles.
These early Jews had a Judaic culture and had “won their emancipation, and began to multiply and flourish.”
The Gentiles in Rome had a culture with a significant Hellenistic influence, which the Apostle Paul understood well because of his experiences at Athens and Corinth.
Paul sets forth the gospel of Jesus Christ in a comprehensive fashion.
He chronicles pertinent aspects of both Judaic and Gentile culture that conflict with the true gospel of Jesus Christ.
He essentially asks each of them to leave behind cultural impediments from their beliefs and culture that are not consistent with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Paul admonishes the Jews and the Gentiles to keep the commandments and love one another and affirms that righteousness leads to salvation.
The culture of the gospel of Jesus Christ is not a Gentile culture or a Judaic culture.
It is not determined by the color of one’s skin or where one lives.
While we rejoice in distinctive cultures, we should leave behind aspects of those cultures that conflict with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
Our members and new converts often come from diverse racial and cultural backgrounds.
If we are to follow President Nelson’s admonition to gather scattered Israel, we will find we are as different as the Jews and Gentiles were in Paul’s time.
Yet we can be united in our love of and faith in Jesus Christ.
Paul’s Epistle to the Romans establishes the principle that we follow the culture and doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
It is the model for us even today.
The ordinances of the temple unite us in special ways and allow us to be one in every eternally significant way.
We honor our pioneer members across the world not because they were perfect but because they overcame hardships, made sacrifices, aspired to be Christlike, and were striving to build faith and be one with the Savior.
Their oneness with the Savior made them one with each other.
This principle is true for you and me today.
The clarion call to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is to strive to be a Zion people who are of one heart and one mind and dwell in righteousness.
It is my prayer that we will be righteous and united and completely focused on serving and worshipping our Savior, Jesus Christ, of whom I testify.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Sustainable Societies
By Elder D.Todd Christofferson
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
If enough of us and enough of our neighbors strive to guide our lives by the truth of God, the moral virtues needed in every society will abound.
What a beautiful choir singing of the beautiful Savior.
In 2015 the United Nations adopted what was called “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.”
It was described as “a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.” The Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 goals to be achieved by the year 2030, such as no poverty, zero hunger, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and decent work.
The concept of sustainable development is an interesting and important one.
Even more urgent, however, is the broader question of sustainable societies.
What are the fundamentals that sustain a flourishing society, one that promotes happiness, progress, peace, and well-being among its members?
We have scriptural record of at least two such thriving societies.
What can we learn from them?
Anciently, the great patriarch and prophet Enoch preached righteousness and “built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion.”
It is reported that “the Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them.”
“And the Lord blessed the land, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.”
The first- and second-century peoples in the Western Hemisphere known as Nephites and Lamanites provide another outstanding example of a flourishing society.
Following the resurrected Savior’s remarkable ministry among them, “they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.
…
“And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God.”
The societies in these two examples were sustained by the blessings of heaven growing out of their exemplary devotion to the two great commandments: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” and “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”
They were obedient to God in their personal lives, and they looked after one another’s physical and spiritual welfare.
In the words of the Doctrine and Covenants, these were societies with “every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.”
Unfortunately, as Elder Quentin L. Cook noted this morning, the ideal society described in 4 Nephi of the Book of Mormon did not endure beyond its second century.
Sustainability is not guaranteed, and a thriving society can fail in time if it abandons the cardinal virtues that uphold its peace and prosperity.
In this case, yielding to the temptations of the devil, the people “began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.”
“And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed away, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another.”
By the end of another century, millions had died in internecine warfare, and their once harmonious nation had been reduced to warring tribes.
Reflecting on this and other examples of once flourishing societies that later foundered, I think it safe to say that when people turn from a sense of accountability to God and begin to trust instead in the “arm of flesh,” disaster lurks.
Trusting in the arm of flesh is to ignore the divine Author of human rights and human dignity and to give highest priority to riches, power, and the praise of the world (while often mocking and persecuting those who follow a different standard).
Meanwhile, those in sustainable societies are seeking, as King Benjamin said, to “grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created [them], or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.”
The institutions of family and religion have been crucial for endowing both individuals and communities with the virtues that sustain an enduring society.
These virtues, rooted in scripture, include integrity, responsibility and accountability, compassion, marriage and fidelity in marriage, respect for others and the property of others, service, and the necessity and dignity of work, among others.
Editor-at-large Gerard Baker wrote a column earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal honoring his father, Frederick Baker, on the occasion of his father’s 100th birthday.
Baker speculated about the reasons for his father’s longevity but then added these thoughts:
“While we may all want to know the secret to a long life, I often feel we’d be better off devoting more time to figuring out what makes a good life, whatever span we’re allotted.
Here, I’m confident I know my father’s secret.
“He is from an era when life was defined primarily by duty, not by entitlement; by social responsibilities, not personal privileges.
The primary animating principle throughout his century has been a sense of obligation—to family, God, country.
“In an era dominated by the detritus of broken families, my father was a devoted husband to his wife of 46 years, a dutiful father to six children.
He was never more present and vital than when my parents suffered the unthinkable tragedy of losing a child.
…
“And in an era when religion is increasingly a curiosity, my father has lived as a true, faithful Catholic, with an unshakable belief in the promises of Christ.
Indeed, I sometimes think he has lived so long because he is better prepared than anyone I have ever met to die.
“I have been a fortunate man—blessed by a good education, my own wonderful family, some worldly success I didn’t deserve.
But however proud and grateful I feel, it’s eclipsed by the pride and gratitude I have for the man who, without fuss or drama, without expectation of reward or even acknowledgment, has got on—for a century now—with the simple duties, obligations and, ultimately, joys of living a virtuous life.”
The perceived importance of religion and religious faith has declined in many nations in recent years.
A growing number of people consider that belief in and allegiance to God are not needed for moral uprightness in either individuals or societies in today’s world.
I think we would all agree that those who profess no religious belief can be, and often are, good, moral people.
We would not agree, however, that this happens without divine influence.
I am referring to the Light of Christ.
The Savior declared, “I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”
Whether aware of it or not, every man, woman, and child of every belief, place, and time is imbued with the Light of Christ and therefore possesses the sense of right and wrong we often call conscience.
Nevertheless, when secularization separates personal and civic virtue from a sense of accountability to God, it cuts the plant from its roots.
Reliance on culture and tradition alone will not be sufficient to sustain virtue in society.
When one has no higher god than himself and seeks no greater good than satisfying his own appetites and preferences, the effects will be manifest in due course.
A society, for example, in which individual consent is the only constraint on sexual activity is a society in decay.
Adultery, promiscuity, out-of-wedlock births, and elective abortions are but some of the bitter fruits that grow out of the ongoing sexual revolution.
Follow-on consequences that work against sustainability of a healthy society include growing numbers of children raised in poverty and without the positive influence of fathers, sometimes through multiple generations; women bearing alone what should be shared responsibilities; and seriously deficient education as schools, like other institutions, are tasked to compensate for failure in the home.
Added to these social pathologies are the incalculable instances of individual heartbreak and despair—mental and emotional destruction visited upon both the guilty and the innocent.
Nephi proclaims:
“Wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost! …
“… Wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God!”
In contrast, our joyous message to our children and to all humanity is that “the truth of God” points a better way, or as Paul said, “a more excellent way,” a way to personal happiness and community well-being now and to everlasting peace and joy hereafter.
The truth of God refers to the core truths that underlie His plan of happiness for His children.
These truths are that God lives; that He is the Heavenly Father of our spirits; that as a manifestation of His love, He has given us commandments that lead to a fulness of joy with Him; that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and our Redeemer; that He suffered and died to atone for sins on condition of our repentance; that He rose from the dead, bringing to pass the Resurrection of all humankind; and that we will all stand before Him to be judged, that is, to account for our lives.
Nine years into what was called “the reign of the judges” in the Book of Mormon, the prophet Alma resigned his position as chief judge to give full time to his leadership of the Church.
His purpose was to address the pride, persecution, and greed that were growing among the people and particularly among members of the Church.
As Elder Stephen D. Nadauld once observed, “[Alma’s] inspired decision was not to spend more time trying to make and enforce more rules to correct the behavior of his people, but to speak to them of the word of God, to teach the doctrine and have their understanding of the plan of redemption lead them to change their behavior.”
There is much we can do as neighbors and fellow citizens to contribute to the sustainability and success of the societies we live in,
and surely our most fundamental and enduring service will be to teach and live by the truths inherent in God’s great plan of redemption.
As expressed in the words of the hymn:
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach thee, too, as love knows how,
By kindly words and virtuous life.
If enough of us and enough of our neighbors strive to make our decisions and guide our lives by the truth of God, the moral virtues needed in every society will abound.
In His love, our Heavenly Father gave His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that we might have everlasting life.
“[Jesus Christ] doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him.
Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
“Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without price.”
This we declare “in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness,” and in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
Finding Joy in Christ
By Steven J. Lund
Young Men General President
The surest way to find joy in this life is to join Christ in helping others.
The Lord does not ask our Aaronic Priesthood youth to do everything, but what He does ask is awe-inspiring.
A few years ago, our little family went through what many families face in this fallen world.
Our youngest son, Tanner Christian Lund, contracted cancer.
He was an incredible soul, as nine-year-olds tend to be.
He was hilariously mischievous and, at the same time, stunningly spiritually aware.
Imp and angel, naughty and nice.
When he was little and was every day bewildering us with his shenanigans, we wondered if he was going to grow up to be the prophet or a bank robber.
Either way, it seemed that he was going to leave a mark on the world.
And then he became desperately ill.
Over the next three years, modern medicine employed heroic measures, including two bone marrow transplants, where he caught pneumonia, requiring him to spend 10 weeks unconscious on a ventilator.
Miraculously, he recovered for a short time, but then his cancer returned.
Shortly before he passed away, Tanner’s disease had invaded his bones, and even with strong pain medicines, still he hurt.
He could barely get out of bed.
One Sunday morning, his mom, Kalleen, came into his room to check on him before the family left for church.
She was surprised to see that he had somehow gotten himself dressed and was sitting on the edge of his bed, painfully struggling to button his shirt.
Kalleen sat down by him.
“Tanner,” she said, “are you sure you are strong enough to go to church? Maybe you should stay home and rest today.”
He stared at the floor.
He was a deacon.
He had a quorum.
And he had an assignment.
“I’m supposed to pass the sacrament today.”
“Well, I’m sure someone could do that for you.”
“Yes,” he said, “but … I see how people look at me when I pass the sacrament.
I think it helps them.”
So Kalleen helped him button his shirt and tie his tie, and they drove to church.
Clearly, something important was happening.
I came to church from an earlier meeting and so was surprised to see Tanner sitting on the deacons’ row.
Kalleen quietly told me why he was there and what he had said: “It helps people.”
And so I watched as the deacons stepped to the sacrament table.
He leaned gently against another deacon as the priests passed them the bread trays.
And then Tanner shuffled to his appointed place and took hold of the end of the pew to steady himself as he presented the sacrament.
It seemed that every eye in the chapel was on him, moved by his struggle as he did his simple part.
Somehow Tanner expressed a silent sermon as he solemnly, haltingly moved from row to row—his bald head moist with perspiration—representing the Savior in the way that deacons do.
His once indomitable deacon’s body was itself a little bruised, broken, and torn, willingly suffering to serve by bearing the emblems of the Savior’s Atonement into our lives.
Seeing how he had come to think about being a deacon made us think differently too—about the sacrament, about the Savior, and about deacons and teachers and priests.
I wonder at the unspoken miracle that had impelled him that morning to respond so bravely to that still, small call to serve, and about the strength and capacities of all of our emergent youth as they push themselves to respond to a prophet’s call to enlist in God’s battalions and join in the work of salvation and exaltation.
Every time a deacon holds a sacrament tray, we are reminded of the sacred story of the Last Supper, of Gethsemane, of Calvary, and of the garden tomb.
When the Savior said to His Apostles, “This do in remembrance of me,” He was also speaking through the ages to each of us.
He was speaking of the unending miracle that He would provide as future deacons, teachers, and priests would present His emblems and invite His children to accept His atoning gift.
All of the sacramental symbols point us to that gift.
We contemplate the bread that He once broke—and the bread the priests before us are, in turn, now breaking.
We think of the meaning of the liquid consecrated,
then and now, as sacrament prayers solemnly pass from the mouths of young priests into our hearts and into the heavens, renewing covenants that connect us to the very powers of Christ’s salvation.
We may think about what it means when a deacon carries the sacred emblems to us, standing as he does where Jesus would stand if He were there, offering to lift our burdens and our pain.
Fortunately, young men and women do not have to get sick to discover joy and purpose in serving the Savior.
Elder David A. Bednar has taught that to grow and become as missionaries are, we should do what missionaries do, and then, “line upon line and precept upon precept, … [we] can gradually become the missionary … the Savior expects.”
Likewise, if we desire “to be like Jesus,” we should do what Jesus does, and in one astonishing sentence, the Lord explains what it is that He does: He said, “For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.”
The Savior’s mission has always and forever been to serve His Father by saving His children.
And the surest way to find joy in this life is to join Christ in helping others.
This is the simple truth that inspired the Children and Youth program.
All Children and Youth activities and all Children and Youth teachings are about helping young people become more like Jesus by joining with Him in His work of salvation and exaltation.
Children and Youth is a tool to help every Primary child and youth to grow in discipleship and to gain a faith-filled vision of what the way of happiness looks like.
They can come to anticipate and yearn for the way stations and signposts along the covenant path,
where they will be baptized and confirmed with the gift of the Holy Ghost and soon belong to quorums and Young Women classes, where they will feel the joy of helping others through a succession of Christlike acts of service.
They will set goals, large and small, that will bring balance to their lives as they become more like the Savior.
For the Strength of Youth conferences and magazines, the Friend, and the Gospel Living app will help center them in finding joy in Christ.
They will anticipate the blessings of holding limited-use temple recommends and feel the spirit of Elijah through the influence of the Holy Ghost as they pursue the blessings of the temple and family history.
They will be guided by patriarchal blessings.
In time, they will see themselves going into temples to be endowed with power and to find joy there as they are eternally connected, come what may, with their families.
Against headwinds of pandemic and calamity, bringing about the full promise of the new Children and Youth program is still a work in progress—but there is urgency.
Our youth cannot wait for the world to right itself before they come to know the Savior.
Some are making decisions even now that they would not make if they understood their true identities—and His.
And so the urgent call from God’s battalions in fateful training is for “all hands on deck!”
Moms and dads, your sons need you to support them now as passionately as ever you have in the past when they have been about lesser things like badges and pins.
Mothers and fathers, priesthood and Young Women leaders, if your youth are struggling, Children and Youth will help bring them to the Savior, and the Savior will bring them peace.
Quorum and class presidencies, step up and take your rightful place in the Lord’s work.
Bishops, link your keys with those of quorum presidents, and your quorums—and your wards—will forever change.
And to you of the rising generation, I testify, as one who knows, that you are beloved sons and daughters of God and He has a work for you to do.
As you rise to the majesty of your stations, with all of your hearts, might, mind, and strength, you will come to love God and keep your covenants and trust in His priesthood as you work to bless others, beginning in your own homes.
I pray that you will strive, with redoubled energy worthy of this time, to serve, exercise faith, repent, and improve each day, to qualify to receive temple blessings and the enduring joy that comes only through the gospel of Jesus Christ.
I pray that you will prepare to become that diligent missionary, loyal husband or wife, loving father or mother that you have been promised you may ultimately become by being a true disciple of Jesus Christ.
May you help prepare the world for the Savior’s return by inviting all to come unto Christ and receive the blessings of His Atonement.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
The Exquisite Gift of the Son
By Elder Matthew S. Holland
Of the Seventy
Through Jesus Christ, we can escape the deserved agonies of our moral failings and overcome the undeserved agonies of our mortal misfortunes.
While reading the Book of Mormon for a Come, Follow Me lesson last summer, I was struck by Alma’s report that when he became fully conscious of his sins, there was “nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were [his] pains.”
I confess, talk of exquisite pain caught my attention partly due to my battle that week with a seven-millimeter kidney stone.
Never has one man experienced such “great things” when such a “small and simple” thing was “brought to pass.”
Alma’s language also stood out to me because the word exquisite, in the English translation of the Book of Mormon, typically describes things of exceptional beauty or unparalleled magnificence.
For example, Joseph Smith noted that the angel Moroni wore robes of “exquisite whiteness,” “a whiteness beyond anything earthly [he] had ever seen.”
Yet exquisite can also convey an extreme intensity even for awful things.
Thus Alma and top dictionaries link exquisite pain to being “tormented,” “racked,” and “harrowed” to the “greatest degree.”
Alma’s imagery reflects the sobering reality that at some point the full, excruciating guilt of every sin we commit must be felt.
Justice demands it, and God Himself cannot change it.
When Alma remembered “all” his sins—especially those that had destroyed the faith of others—his pain was virtually unbearable, and the idea of standing before God filled him with “inexpressible horror.”
He yearned to “become extinct both soul and body.”
However, Alma said everything started to change the moment his “mind caught hold upon” the prophesied “coming of one Jesus Christ … to atone for the sins of the world” and he “cried within [his] heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me.”
With that one thought and that one plea, Alma was filled with “exquisite” joy “as exceeding as was [his] pain.”
We must never forget that the very purpose of repentance is to take certain misery and transform it into pure bliss.
Thanks to His “immediate goodness,” the instant we come unto Christ—demonstrating faith in Him and a true change of heart—the crushing weight of our sins starts to shift from our backs to His.
This is possible only because He who is without sin suffered “the infinite and unspeakable agony” of every single sin in the universe of His creations, for all of His creations—a suffering so severe, blood oozed out of His every pore.
From direct, personal experience the Savior thus warns us, in modern scripture, that we have no idea how “exquisite” our “sufferings” will be if we do not repent.
But with unfathomable generosity He also clarifies that “I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent”—a repentance which allows us to “taste” the “exceeding joy” Alma tasted.
For this doctrine alone, “I stand all amazed.”
Yet, astonishingly, Christ offers even more.
Sometimes exquisite pain comes not from sin but from honest mistakes, the actions of others, or forces beyond our control.
In these moments, you may cry like the righteous Psalmist:
“My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
“… And horror hath overwhelmed me.
“… Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.”
Medical science, professional counseling, or legal rectification can help alleviate such suffering.
But note, all good gifts—including these—come from the Savior.
Regardless of the causes of our worst hurts and heartaches, the ultimate source of relief is the same: Jesus Christ.
He alone holds the full power and healing balm to correct every mistake, right every wrong, adjust every imperfection, mend every wound, and deliver every delayed blessing.
Like witnesses of old, I testify that “we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities” but rather a loving Redeemer who descended from His throne above and went forth “suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind … , that he may know … how to succor his people.”
For anyone today with pains so intense or so unique that you feel no one else could fully appreciate them, you may have a point.
There may be no family member, friend, or priesthood leader—however sensitive and well-meaning each may be—who knows exactly what you are feeling or has the precise words to help you heal.
But know this: there is One who understands perfectly what you are experiencing, who is “mightier than all the earth,” and who is “able to do exceeding abundantly above all that [you] ask or think.”
The process will unfold in His way and on His schedule, but Christ stands ready always to heal every ounce and aspect of your agony.
As you allow Him to do so, you will discover that your suffering was not in vain.
Speaking of many of the Bible’s greatest heroes and their griefs, the Apostle Paul said that “God … provided some better things for them through their sufferings, for without sufferings they could not be made perfect.”
You see, the very nature of God and aim of our earthly existence is happiness, but we cannot become perfect beings of divine joy without experiences that test us, sometimes to our very core.
Paul says even the Savior Himself was made eternally “perfect [or complete] through sufferings.”
So guard against the satanic whispering that if you were a better person, you would avoid such trials.
You must also resist the related lie that your sufferings somehow suggest you stand outside the circle of God’s chosen ones, who seem to glide from one blessed state to another.
Instead, see yourself as John the Revelator surely saw you in his majestic revelation of the latter days.
For John saw “a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, [who] stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, … [who] cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God.”
When asked: “What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?” John received the answer: “These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.”
Brothers and sisters, suffering in righteousness helps qualify you for, rather than distinguishes you from, God’s elect.
And it makes their promises your promises.
As John declares, you “shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on [you], nor any heat.
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed [you], and shall lead [you] unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from [your] eyes.”
“And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.”
I witness to you that through the staggering goodness of Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement, we can escape the deserved agonies of our moral failings and overcome the undeserved agonies of our mortal misfortunes.
Under His direction, your divine destiny will be one of unparalleled magnificence and indescribable joy—a joy so intense and so unique to you, your particular “ashes” will become beauties “beyond anything earthly.”
That you might taste this happiness now and be filled with it forever, I invite you to do what Alma did: let your mind catch hold on the exquisite gift of the Son of God as revealed through His gospel in this, His true and living Church.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
The Culture of Christ
By Elder William K. Jackson
Of the Seventy
We can cherish the best of our individual earthly cultures and be full participants in the eternal culture that comes from the gospel of Jesus Christ.
What a magnificent world we live in and share, home to a great diversity of peoples, languages, customs, and histories—spread out over hundreds of countries and thousands of groups, each rich in culture.
Mankind has much to be proud of and to celebrate.
But though learned behavior—those things to which we are exposed by the cultures we grow up in—can serve as a great strength in our lives, it can also, at times, become a significant obstacle.
It may seem that culture is so heavily embedded in our thinking and behavior that it is impossible to change.
It is, after all, much of what we feel defines us and from which we feel a sense of identity.
It can be such a strong influence that we can fail to see the man-made weaknesses or flaws in our own cultures, resulting in a reluctance to throw off some of the traditions of our fathers.
An overfixation on one’s cultural identity may lead to the rejection of worthwhile—even godly—ideas, attributes, and behavior.
I knew a wonderful gentleman not too many years ago who helps to illustrate this universal principle of cultural myopia.
I first met him in Singapore when I was assigned to be his family’s home teacher.
A distinguished professor of Sanskrit and Tamil, he hailed from the south of India.
His wonderful wife and two sons were members of the Church, but he had never joined nor listened much to the teachings of the gospel.
He was happy with the way his wife and sons were developing and supported them fully in their undertakings and Church responsibilities.
When I offered to teach him the principles of the gospel and share our beliefs with him, he initially balked.
It took me a while to figure out why: he felt that by so doing, he would become a traitor to his past, his people, and his history! To his way of thinking, he would be denying everything he was, everything his family had taught him to be, his very Indian heritage.
Over the next few months, we were able to talk about these issues.
I was awed (though not surprised!) by how the gospel of Jesus Christ was able to open his eyes to a different viewpoint.
In most man-made cultures, there is found both good and bad, constructive and destructive.
Many of our world’s problems are a direct result of clashes between those of differing ideas and customs arising from their culture.
But virtually all conflict and chaos would quickly fade if the world would only accept its original culture, the one we all possessed not so very long ago.
This culture dates back to our premortal existence.
It was the culture of Adam and Enoch.
It was the culture founded on the Savior’s teachings in the meridian of time, and it is available to all women and men once again in our day.
It is unique.
It is the greatest of all cultures and comes from the great plan of happiness, authored by God and championed by Christ.
It unites rather than divides.
It heals rather than harms.
The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that there is purpose in life.
Our being here is not just some big cosmic accident or mistake! We are here for a reason.
This culture is grounded in the testimony that our Heavenly Father exists, that He is real and loves each one of us individually.
We are His “work and [His] glory.”
This culture espouses the concept of equal worth.
There is no recognition of caste or class.
We are, after all, brothers and sisters, spirit children of our heavenly parents—literally.
There is no prejudice or “us versus them” mentality in the greatest of all cultures.
We are all “us.”
We are all “them.”
We believe that we are responsible and accountable for ourselves, one another, the Church, and our world.
Responsibility and accountability are important factors in our growth.
Charity, true Christlike caring, is the bedrock of this culture.
We feel real concern for the needs of our fellowman, temporal and spiritual, and act on those feelings.
This dispels prejudice and hatred.
We enjoy a culture of revelation, centered on the word of God as received by the prophets (and personally verifiable to each one of us through the Holy Ghost).
All humankind can know the will and mind of God.
This culture champions the principle of agency.
The ability to choose is extremely important for our development and our happiness.
Choosing wisely is essential.
It is a culture of learning and study.
We seek knowledge and wisdom and the best in all things.
It is a culture of faith and obedience.
Faith in Jesus Christ is the first principle of our culture, and obedience to His teachings and commandments is the outcome.
These give rise to self-mastery.
It is a culture of prayer.
We believe that God will not only hear us but also help us.
It is a culture of covenants and ordinances, high moral standards, sacrifice, forgiveness and repentance, and caring for the temple of our bodies.
All of these bear witness to our commitment to God.
It is a culture governed by the priesthood, the authority to act in God’s name, the power of God to bless His children.
It edifies and enables individuals to be better people, leaders, mothers, fathers, and companions—and it sanctifies the home.
True miracles abound in this, the oldest of all cultures, wrought by faith in Jesus Christ, the power of the priesthood, prayer, self-improvement, true conversion, and forgiveness.
It is a culture of missionary work.
The worth of souls is great.
In the culture of Christ, women are elevated to their proper and eternal status.
They are not subservient to men, as in many cultures in today’s world, but full and equal partners here and in the world to come.
This culture sanctions the sanctity of the family.
The family is the basic unit of eternity.
The perfection of the family is worth any sacrifice because, as has been taught, “no other success can compensate for failure in the home.”
The home is where our best work is done and where our greatest happiness is attained.
In the culture of Christ, there is perspective—and eternal focus and direction.
This culture is concerned with things of lasting worth!
It comes from the gospel of Jesus Christ, which is eternal and explains the why, what, and where of our existence.
(It is inclusive, not exclusive.)
Because this culture results from the application of our Savior’s teachings, it helps provide a healing balm of which our world is in such desperate need.
What a blessing it is to be part of this grand and noble way of life! To be part of this, the greatest of all cultures, will require change.
The prophets have taught that it is necessary to leave behind anything in our old cultures that is inconsistent with the culture of Christ.
But that doesn’t mean we have to leave behind everything.
The prophets have also emphasized that we are invited, one and all, to bring our faith and talents and knowledge—all that is good in our lives and our individual cultures—with us and let the Church “add to it” through the message of the gospel.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is hardly a Western society or an American cultural phenomenon.
It is an international church, as it was always meant to be.
More than that, it is supernal.
New members from around the world bring richness, diversity, and excitement into our ever-growing family.
Latter-day Saints everywhere still celebrate and honor their own heritage and heroes, but now they are also part of something far grander.
The culture of Christ helps us to see ourselves as we really are, and when seen through the lens of eternity, tempered with righteousness, it serves to increase our ability to fulfill the great plan of happiness.
So what happened to my friend? Well, he was taught the lessons and joined the Church.
His family has since been sealed for time and all eternity in the Sydney Australia Temple.
He has given up little—and gained the potential for everything.
He discovered that he can still celebrate his history, still be proud of his ancestry, his music and dance and literature, his food, his land and its people.
He has found that there is no problem incorporating the best of his local culture into the greatest of all cultures.
He discovered that bringing that which is consistent with truth and righteousness from his old life into his new one serves only to enhance his fellowship with the Saints and to assist in uniting all as one in the society of heaven.
We can, indeed, all cherish the best of our individual earthly cultures and still be full participants in the oldest culture of them all—the original, the ultimate, the eternal culture that comes from the gospel of Jesus Christ.
What a marvelous heritage we all share.
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
